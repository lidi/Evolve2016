# Mobile Search - Making your mobile apps stand out
Did you know that only 26% of apps installed on a user's device are used daily? There are several innovative ways to engage with your users and keep them coming back for more after your app is installed. In this session we will explore all of the search options provided by both Apple and Google for iOS and Android, as well as Xamarin.Forms. We will focus exploring all of the great APIs that iOS and Google Play services have to offer and we'll look at Spotlight search, Universal links, and App Indexing to help you connect to your users like never before.
